For reference, here is the data from the csvs
  Answers.csv: id, question_id, body, date_written, user_name, user_email, reported, helpful

  Questions.csv: id, product_id, body, date, user, user_email, reported, helpful

  answers_photos: id, answer_id, url
And my database looks like this:
  Questions: id, product_id, body, date, name_id, helpfulness, reported
  users: id, name, email
  answers: id, question_id, body, date, name_id, helpfulness, reported
  photos: id, answer_id, url

When performing ETL follow the process outlined below:
1. run the userData.js script below to generate the myTest.csv file
2. run the userData.sql commands
3. run the questionDataMerge.sql commands
4. run the answersDataMerge.sql commands
